      <p>What a week! It's Saturday and I'm currently in a co-op work space in downtown San Diego, creating this profile page you see here. I've spent over 50 hours this week working on various projects and "challenges" in javascript and github. To think that on Monday I was disaapointed in not writing much code! Now I'm starting to think in if-else statements; if(hungry){ eat}else stay out of the kitchen!</p>

      <p>Hi! My name is Michael and I'm working towards becoming a software developer. Why? I've spent the last few months looking for jobs and interviewing in San Diego. I have a materials engineering degree and graduated at the top of my class from UCLA. My senior year, I started working for a lab in Malibu California, developing coatings for aerospace applications. Basically, I was a chemist half the day and material test engineer the other half. I resigned, hoping to find something that offered more growth potential and involved less hazardous chemicals. I moved in San Diego to live with my brother after taking a month-long trip across Europe. I thought I'd find a job in no time but it hasn't been easy as a materials engineer in a city where most of the engineering jobs are in biotech or computer science. Every day I would check for "engineering" jobs on indeed and see software engineering positions paying well. I had no idea what a "API", "MySQL", "React", "node.js" was. (to be continued..)
